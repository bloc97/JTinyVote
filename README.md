# JTinyVote
Very simple voting system that accounts for weight, and uses a bit of randomness. Similar to JVote, but smaller

In a simple voting system, only the choice with the highest number of votes win, but in this system, every choice that has at least one voter can win.

The number of voters affects the win chance.

Eg.

Common system:

Choice 1: 76 voters

Choice 2: 45 voters

In this case, Choice 1 will always win, no matter what.


Weighted system:

Choice 1: 75 voters

Choice 2: 25 voters

In this case, Choice 1 will win 75% of the time, while Choice 2 will win 25% of the time.
